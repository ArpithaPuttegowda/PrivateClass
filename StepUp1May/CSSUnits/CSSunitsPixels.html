            <p>One pixel represents a single point on a screen or a device's display.
                It's commonly used for setting precise and fixed dimensions, such as for borders or margins.
                Since px is an absolute unit, it doesn't change with respect to text size adjustments made by the user, which can be a drawback for accessibility.
